# Advent of Code

### This is a collection of my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

Unfortunately, I came to the party a litle bit late, so I'm starting with 2023 now, which I plan to solve in JS.

I will try some other language for the 2024 edition.

> I'm using [aocrunner](https://github.com/caderek/aocrunner) as a template starter for my own solutions.
